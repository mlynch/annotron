      <div id="post">
        <p>The blood-red glow of a slanting sun bathed the towers of New York's
        serrated skyline, then dropped into a molten sea beyond the winter
        horizon. Friday, the last day of Jupiter, the thirteenth month of the
        earth's new calendar, had drawn to a close. In a few hours the year of
        1999 would end--at midnight, to be exact.</p>

        <p>Far below the towers stretched well lighted canyons teeming with
        humanity. At an upper level where once the elevated trains had roared
        and rumbled in an antiquated period long past, an orderly mass of
        workers and shoppers was borne at an incredible speed from lower
        Manhattan to towering apartments that stretched northward to
        Peekskill. The northbound traffic was heaviest at this hour and the
        moving sidewalk bands were jammed to their capacity.</p>

        <p>Street cars, now obsolete, had vanished from the streets under the new
        order of things as had also passenger cars, taxis and trucks. Speed
        predominated. Noise had practically been eliminated. Except for the
        gentle throb of giant motors far underground, the city was cloaked in
        silence.</p>

        <p>At regular intervals along the four-speed moving bands that formed the
        transportation of the great metropolis, huge circular shafts of steel
        mounted upward beyond the roofs of the tallest buildings. Within these
        shafts, swift elevators carried passengers who lived in the outlying
        districts to the level of the station platforms of the interstate
        operating transport planes.</p>
